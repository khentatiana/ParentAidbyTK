## Overview
### Description
ParentAid is an app that helps parents to find and sign-up for COVID-19 safe activities for kids and events based on their locations around the world. The app allows event providers to advertise the events and to  interact with people for their chosen events.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Social Networking
- **Mobile:** This app will be primarily developed for mobile but it can be scaled as a web app. This app is essential for the instant signing up of a child for the activity or event. Providers will use the app to post the information about the activity or event. The camera is used to add event posters, tag them with a location, and then see a map with all the posted events.
- **Story:** We as parents always have been struggling to find activities for kids. Searching, planning, and scheduling takes a tremendous amount of time and effort. As busy parents we were always dreaming about the app that will help with kids activities. Due to the current pandemic of COVID-19, many families all around the world are trying to find activities to keep children get busy and be safe. Now sporting events, festivals, and schools remain closed. 
ParentAid app can help parents cope. It helps parents to find and sign-up kids for different activities nearby and to make sure that they are COVID-19 safe. It helps event providers to advertise and manage all in-person and virtual events. When the pandemic is over, this app will still be a good helper for the parents and happy busy kids.
- **Habit:** Parents are using this constantly throughout the year on a daily basis and around the world to find and sign-up their kids for the activities and events. Event providers are using the app to post information about the coming event and activities offered.
- **Scope:** The future of ParentAid is to scale to add subscription plans for providers to advertise their events and activities starting off with the Basic Plan to post 10 events per year for free but as the tier moves up to Gold or Platinum, the post events will increase upto 20-50 per year with the required feature to include fee for any and all events.
- **Market:** Parents, kids, and event providers could utilize this app.
